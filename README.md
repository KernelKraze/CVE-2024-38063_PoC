# 🚀 Windows TCP/IP Remote Code Execution Vulnerability CVE-2024-38063 Packet Sender

🎭 Are you ready to unleash chaos in a controlled environment? Look no further! This program is your ticket to sending custom-crafted IPv6 packets and exploiting the [Windows TCP/IP Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2024-38063)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-38063). It's like sending a digital love letter, but instead of poetry, you're sending panic! 💌💥

**🚨 Important Note:** This tool is for educational purposes only. Using it without permission is like borrowing your neighbor's Wi-Fi without asking - illegal, unethical, and bound to make family barbecues awkward. 😬

## 🎉 Features

- Sends custom IPv6 packets faster than you can say "oops!"
- Reads payload data from `shellcode.txt` (because typing it manually is so 2023)
- Configurable network interface and target address (for when you want to be precise about your chaos)

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- **Operating System**: Unix-like systems (Linux). Sorry Windows users, the irony is not lost on us! 🤷‍♂️
- **Privileges**: Root access required. Time to dust off that sudo password!
- **Dependencies**: GCC or another C compiler. Because we're old school cool. 😎

## 🏗️ Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```
   Welcome to the danger zone! 🎵

2. **Prepare the Payload**:
   Create `shellcode.txt` in the same directory. Fill it with raw binary shellcode. It's like stuffing a digital piñata! 🪅

3. **Compile the Program**:
   ```bash
   gcc -o ipv6_packet_sender ipv6_packet_sender.c -Wall
   ```
   Congratulations! You've just created a digital grenade! 💣

## 🎮 Usage

### Command-line Arguments

```bash
sudo ./ipv6_packet_sender <interface> <ipv6_address> <mac_address>
```
It's like a game of digital hot potato! 🥔

### Interactive Mode

```bash
sudo ./ipv6_packet_sender
```
For those who like to take things slow and steady. We'll hold your hand through this digital adventure! 🖐️

### Example

```bash
sudo ./ipv6_packet_sender wlo1 fe80::1ff:fe23:4567:890a 00:1a:2b:3c:4d:5e
```
Replace with your target's details. No, your ex's IP address doesn't count! 🙅‍♂️

### Output

Watch as the program sends packets and displays a countdown timer. It's like New Year's Eve, but for hackers! 🎆

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Root Privileges**: We need the big guns for this one. Sudo me, baby! 💪
- **Promiscuous Mode**: Your network card is about to see things it can't unsee. 👀
- **Ethical Usage**: Don't be that guy at the party. Get permission before you start poking around! 🎭

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

- **Permission Denied**: Did you forget the magic word? (It's "sudo") 🧙‍♂️
- **Compilation Errors**: Time to update your C game. It's not just for history books! 📚
- **Payload File Issues**: Make sure `shellcode.txt` exists and isn't just full of your grocery list. 🛒
